# Biodiversity in National Parks portfolio project.

This is my second portfolio project with a larger and more diverse/ complicated data set. This project has been developed in a Jupyter Notebook and therefore is intended to be used with Jupyter and is only intended to be used for reference purposes only. 

Initially I will undertake some project scoping based on the University of Chicago's best practice:

* Step 0: Problem Understanding – What is the problem? Who does it impact and how much? How is it being solved today and what are some of the gaps?
* Step 1: Goals – What are the goals of the project? How will we know if our project is successful?
* Step 2: Actions – What actions or interventions will this work inform?
* Step 3: Data – What data do you have access to internally? What data do you need? What can you augment from external and/or public sources?
* Step 4: Analysis – What analysis needs to be done? Does it involve description, detection, prediction, or behavior change? How will the analysis be validated?
* Ethical Considerations:  What are the privacy, transparency, discrimination/equity, and accountability issues around this project and how will you tackle them?
* Additional Considerations: How will you deploy your analysis as a new system so that it can be updated and integrated into the organization’s operations? How will you evaluate the new system in the field to make sure it accomplishes your goals? How will you monitor your system to make sure it continues to perform well over time?
